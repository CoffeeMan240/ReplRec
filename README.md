# ReplRec
An Experiment to test out how HTTP websockets can be used with OpenRecLive.

As this is an experiment, your data will not save. The server will be made for July 13, 2018 (Steam Depot Id: 7215521011309491864)

I encourage you to do websocket like things as in:

- Change your name
- Change a room
- Maybe message a buddy

and so on.
